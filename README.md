# Finding-joinable-attributes
This page is dedicated for the finding joinable attributes project by the DTIM research group of the ESSI department, UPC. We provide here the main datasets and sources for experimental evaluation.


## Getting started

We provide the datasets used for our training and experiments under the folder "datasets" and the ground truth generated under the folder "groundTruth". All files are provided in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. The information datasets for training and experiments can be found under folder "datasets" in files with the prefix "datasetsInformationXXX" where XXX would be the type of datasets such as training, experiment 1, experiment 2, etc.
